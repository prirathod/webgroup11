								<h2 class="major">Problem statement</h2>
								<h3>Ideal</h3>
									<p>An available web platform to effectively present multiple live data feeds, focusing on real-time visualization of natural hazards, including wildfires, earthquakes, potential tornados (windspeed) in the United States and Canada.</p>
								<h3>Reality</h3>
									<p>The existing available materials lack user-friendliness and accessibility, hindering the public from obtaining and comprehending important information (live updates) regarding natural hazards. </p>
								<h3>Consequences</h3>
									<p>The public remains unaware of critical environmental concerns caused by natural hazards, and not getting time-efficient alarms, leading to long-term concerns. </p>
								<h3>Proposal</h3>
									<p>Present multiple live natural hazards data with various web platforms effectively.</p>
								<h3>Technologies</h3>
									<p>Esri Suites such as ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Dashboard, ArcGIS Storymap. </p>
							</article>
						
						<!-- Methods -->
							<article id="methods">
								<h2 class="major">Methodology</h2>
								<p>Our project adopted a multifaceted approach by creating web maps, and integrating dashboards and story maps to effectively address our problem statement. </p>
								<h3>Data Acquisition</h3>
								<p>To initiate our project, we undertook extensive research to acquire relevant data. 
									Despite encountering numerous data sources, many were limited to historical events or provided static downloads. 
									To ensure the continuous relevance and reliability of our information, we actively retrieved live data from ArcGIS Living Atlas. </p>
							    
								<h3>Data Processing</h3>
								<p>Processing data directly on the web as opposed to local files and software is essential, as it allows for seamless integration of various data formats onto web platforms such as AGOL. 
									Additionally, by processing data online, we ensure accessibility and collaboration among team members.</p>
								<p>We were able to process various data formats onto the web, including CSV, shapefile, JSON/GeoJSON (feature layer), OGC WFS/WMS web service, file geodatabase, ArcGIS Server web service, OGC API. 
									Here are some highlights of the importing process.</p>
								<h4>Comma-separated values (CSV)</h4>
									<p>We published CSV files as feature layers to augment the functionality and efficacy of our solutions. 
										The sources were authoritative with high data quality, however, the data were limited to static downloads. Thus, we aborted this option. </p>
								<h4>Web Feature Service (WFS) and Web Map Service (WMS)</h4>
									<p>Utilizing WFS and WMS was instrumental in updating the NASA FIRMS live wildfires data. 
										Through an URL provided by NASA, the data was integrated seamlessly into our platform, ensuring its real-time nature. 
										Additionally, enabling the "set refresh interval" feature ensures that the data is continuously updated at predefined intervals, maintaining its accuracy.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/WFSimport.PNG" alt="" ></span>
								<h4>Combining Different Datasets Through ArcGIS Merging Tool</h4>
									<p>Identify the layers you want to merge, which can be feature layers, CSV files, or shapefiles. 
										And, add the layers to the Map Viewer. By using the Merge tool in the Analysis tab to combine the layers. 
										The Merge tool combines features from two layers of the same feature type into a new layer. 
										In the Merge settings, select the fields you want to include and how to handle them (rename, remove, or match). 
										Check the estimated ArcGIS Online credits required before running the analysis. 
										Save the merged layer to your content. Verify the merged layer and use it in your maps and apps.</p>

								<h4>Masking Features on a Web Map</h4>
									<p>Masking Features on a Web Map
										Given that the live earthquake data source encompassed global events, masking techniques on AGOL were employed to focus solely on the US and Canada. 
										This ensures that our web map provides relevant and localized information to our target audience.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Masking.PNG" alt="" ></span>
								<h3>Web Platform Production</h3>
								<p>To enhance user experience, we implemented strategies to dynamically modify the data, including decluttering the map by toggling off unnecessary layers. </p>
								<p>Please view more details on the "Solution" page. </p>
								<h3>Story Map</h3>
								<p>Following the creation of the ArcGIS Dashboard, we used the ArcGIS Platform to create a Story Map that captured the main ideas of our project. 
									This Story Map was created to improve the user's understanding of our project. We demonstrated how to create an interactive dashboard that displays real-time hazard data and draws boundaries between hazardous circumstances in the USA and Canada. 
									We utilized maps, multimedia content, textual elements, Dashboard and a variety of other components to construct our Story Map.We wanted to clarify the various advantages that come with using a dashboard with this story. </p>
								<h3>Concerns and Future Steps</h3>
								<p>While the NASA FIRMS wildfire data provided live updates, we encountered challenges such as including non-relevant hotspots, like industrial emissions. 
									In future trials, we aim to refine our data filtering techniques to enhance the accuracy of our visualizations. </p>
								<p>Moreover, exploring scripting options to actively read updating csv files could further augment our data acquisition capabilities.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Deliverables</h2>
								<p>We intended to deliver two primary outcomes for our project: ArcGIS Dashboards and ArcGIS StoryMaps. The dashboard featured all real-time data integrated into a single web map, offering a user-friendly interface for monitoring forest fires, earthquakes, and tornadoes across the USA and Canada. 
									We've enhanced the dashboard's interactivity and user-friendliness by incorporating various elements to improve data visualization</p>
								<h3 class="major"><a href="https://fleming.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/8a2d1b7e63964577b6f9c015d7551d9a">Natural Hazards Dashboard</a></h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/DASHBOARDnew.png" alt=""></span>
								<p> We collected real-time data from various authoritative sources. The earthquakes, forest fires, and tornadoes were from United States Geological Survey (USGS), the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), Natural Resource Canada (NRCan), Integrated Reporting of Wildland-Fire Information (IRWIN), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) respectively. 
									Through ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Dashboards, we designed a user-friendly interface with interactive maps, charts, and widgets to visualize key metrics and trends in real-time. Our dashboard updated the latest information continuously, providing timely insights.
								</p>
								<p>We had maps on our dashboard displaying real-time data together with various map-enhancing components. The pie chart showcased causes of forest fires in USA, and active fire stages in Canada. More forest fires information like counts and covered area size were included in tables. 
									The earthquake magnitude across both countries was shown in a bar graph. Storm information for the US was displayed in a line graph and a gauge. There was also a website with weather update on selected locations in Canada. 
									The interface design for browsing real-time data was straightforward and user-friendly.
