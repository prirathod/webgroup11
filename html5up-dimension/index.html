								<h1>Natural Hazard Mapping ACROSS Canada & U.S.A</h1>
								<p>Our Group aims to provide real-time insights into <a href="https://fleming.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/8a2d1b7e63964577b6f9c015d7551d9a">natural hazards such as forest fires, Tornado and Wind Speed across the USA and Canada</a>. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of ArcGIS Dashboard and <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/5abc1f17b7b74ac8928e2589fb043d8c">Story Map</a>, we offer dynamic visualizations that showcase live data feeds, enabling stakeholders to monitor and respond to evolving threats effectively of U.S.A. and Canada.</p>

								<p>Over the past five weeks of our GEOM099 course, we explored various web technologies, with a keen eye on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools. 
									As a group, we are dedicated to enhancing disaster awareness and fostering rapid response by monitoring active natural disasters. 
									We focused on creating a comprehensive web interface to provide real-time data compilation on natural disasters over Canada and the US, specifically earthquakes, wildfires, and tornados. </p>
								<p>We aimed to design a solution that not only aggregates and visualizes live disaster data effectively but also prioritizes ease of use for end users. 
									ArcGIS suite stood out for its intuitive interface and robust features. We included ArcGIS Online as for database management and web map creation, ArcGIS Dashboards to showcase data in a straightforward way, and ArcGIS StoryMaps for background information and more details. 
									By documenting contributions and maintaining transparent communication, we ensured a focus on user interface design throughout development. </p>
								<p>As we near completion, we're excited to unveil our visually appealing and intuitive web platforms. 
									This project highlights our dedication to delivering impactful solutions that prioritize user experience and accessibility in GIS technology.</p>
								<p>Whether you're an individual seeking to stay informed or an organization dedicated to disaster preparedness, there are numerous ways to get involved. 
									Explore our website to learn more about our work, initiatives, and team members.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Problem statement</h2>
								<h3>Ideal</h3>
									<p>An available web platform to effectively present multiple live data feeds, focusing on real-time visualization of natural hazards, including wildfires, earthquakes, potential tornados (windspeed) in the United States and Canada.</p>
								<h3>Reality</h3>
									<p>The existing available materials lack user-friendliness and accessibility, hindering the public from obtaining and comprehending important information (live updates) regarding natural hazards. </p>
								<h3>Consequences</h3>
									<p>The public remains unaware of critical environmental concerns caused by natural hazards, and not getting time-efficient alarms, leading to long-term concerns. </p>
								<h3>Proposal</h3>
									<p>Present multiple live natural hazards data with various web platforms effectively.</p>
								<h3>Technologies</h3>
									<p>Esri Suites such as ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Dashboard, ArcGIS Storymap. </p>

						<!-- Methods -->
						<article id="methods">
							<h2 class="major">Methodology</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>In our project, we adopted a multifaceted approach, integrating dashboards, story maps, and web maps to effectively address our problem statement. Furthermore, we utilized technical methods such as publishing CSV files as feature layers to augment the functionality and efficacy of our solutions.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p> Additionally, we actively retrieved live data from ArcGIS Online Living Atlas, ensuring the continuous relevance and reliability of our information. To enhance user experience, we implemented strategies to dynamically modify the data, including decluttering the map by toggling off unnecessary layers. </p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<p>This meticulous approach aimed to provide users with clear and concise information, preventing the map from appearing overly cluttered or overwhelming. By amalgamating technical expertise with innovative strategies, our objective was to craft a seamless and intuitive platform for accessing real-time data on natural disasters in the USA and Canada.</p></article>

								<h2 class="major">Deliverables</h2>
								<p>We intnded to deliver two primary outcomes for our project: an ArcGIS Dashboard and an ArcGIS Story Map. The Dashboard will feature real-time data integrated into a web map, offering a user-friendly interface for monitoring forest fires, earthquakes, and tornadoes across the USA and Canada. We've enhanced the Dashboard's interactivity and user-friendliness by incorporating various elements to improve data visualization</p>
								<h3 class="major"><a href="https://fleming.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/8a2d1b7e63964577b6f9c015d7551d9a">Natural Hazards Dashboard</a></h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/DASHBOARDnew.png" alt=""/></span>
								<p> We collect real-time data from authoritative sources United States Geological Survey (USGS), the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), Natural Resource Canada (NRCan), Integrated Reporting of Wildland-Fire Information (IRWIN), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for earthquakes, forest fires, and tornadoes respectively. we assembled the live data in a single platform.
									Through ArcGIS Online and the Dashboard Builder, we designed a user-friendly interface with interactive maps, charts, and widgets to visualize key metrics and trends in real-time. our dashboard continuously updates with the latest information, providing timely insights.
								</p>
								<p>We have maps on our dashboard that display real-time data together with various map-enhancing components. The US forest causes and the Canadian active fire stages are depicted in this pie chart. 
									The earthquake magnitude over the USA and Canada is shown in a bar graph. Tables displaying the number of storms in the previous week and the active forest fires in the USA and Canada. This real-time data display is straightforward to use and user-friendly.

								<br></br>
								<p> ArcGIS StoryMaps, developed by Esri, is a versatile platform designed for users to craft engaging narratives using maps, text, multimedia content, and various other elements.
								In our application of ArcGIS StoryMaps, we utilized it to showcase the current hazard conditions in both the USA and Canada. We demonstrated how we created an interactive dashboard to visualize live hazard data, illustrating the potential benefits derived from utilizing such a dashboard.

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Wildfire.png" alt=""/></span>
								<p> This image shows the map of the active wild fires of USA and Canada. Live data helps in early detection and monitoring of wildfires. This can help to identify areas with high risk and issue timely evacuation orders to ensure public safety.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Earthquake.PNG" alt=""/></span>
								<p>This image shows the map of the Earthquake of USA and Canada. Live earthquake data is crucial for early warning systems. It helps emergency responders to access the magnitude and location of an earthquake rapidly.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Storm.PNG" alt=""/></span>
								<p>This image shows the map of the Storm across the USA and Canada. The live data of windspeed is crucial for issuing early warnings, reducing the potential risk. It helps to access the risk to specific areas, allowing authorities to implement targeted emergency response plans.</p>
